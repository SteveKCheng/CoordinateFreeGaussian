# Coordinate-free characterization of the multi-variate Gaussian distribution

Source for a short mathematical text by the author.

It introduces the theory of the multi-variate Gaussian (normal) probability distribution.
It derives everything in an elegant, coordinate-free manner, using the full power
of the modern theory of vector spaces (from linear algebra), 
unlike many existing textbooks on probability and statistics.

As far as the author knows, the article has no mathematical mistakes, but
it is still a draft that needs polishing.
